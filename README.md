# PICSTAR, Z-Control development board

Copy of the documentation published on www.z-control.ch from 2010 to 2015

#Contents

Doc: documentation of the PICSTAR PCB designed in 2010-2011 as generic robotic board. The PCB was build around PIC18F4550, 2 H-Bridges, 5V and 3.3V power regulators, many connectors to connect Servo motors, DC motors, I2C and SPI components running under both voltages.

Lib: The library files contain basic code/drivers used in the examples. They where originally stored in a "shared" folder

Examples: Simple basic examples that can be used to start projects.
