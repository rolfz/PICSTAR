#Contents

__Doc:__ documentation of the PICSTAR PCB designed in 2010-2011 as generic robotic board. The PCB was build around PIC18F4550, 2 H-Bridges, 5V and 3.3V power regulators, many connectors to connect Servo motors, DC motors, I2C and SPI components running under both voltages.

__Lib:__ The library files contain basic code/drivers used in the examples. They where originally stored in a "shared" folder

__Examples:__ Simple basic examples that can be used to start projects.

__Tools:__ Bootloader firmware for PIC18f4550, basically the Microchip Bootloader example. Uses 1k hex bytes. Tools alos contains  the windows bootloader executable.
